      </h1>


<p>
We run a virus check on the photo of your I.D. before it is verified. If the file you upload is infected or damaged, you can try and upload another one. 
</p>

<p>
If this keeps happening, there might be a problem with your device. You can try taking a photo using a different device and upload it from there. For example, you could borrow a family member’s device to take and upload a photo instead. Once verified, you can then use NHS login on your usual device as normal.
</p>

<p>
You can also prove who you are without using photo I.D. by using the registration details from your GP surgery’s online services.
</p>

<p>
If you do not know or remember your registration details, you can ask your GP to give you them.
</p>

<p>The 3 details you need are:
<ul>
<li>Linkage Key (could be called Passphrase)</li>
<li>O.D.S. Code (could be called Organisation Code or Practice I.D.)</li>
<li>Account I.D.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
If you are not registered for your GP surgery’s online services, tell your GP surgery that you want to register, and they will ask you to fill in a form. Your surgery will then give you the 3 registration details.
