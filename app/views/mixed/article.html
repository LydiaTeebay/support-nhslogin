  <h2 id="error2011">What does reference CID2011 mean?</h2>


<p>
Every time you log in to a website or app using your NHS login, we check your NHS number. This allows us to connect you to your information securely.
</p>

    </p>

    <hr>

  <h2 id="error2012">What does reference CID2012 mean?</h2>
 

<p>
Every time you log in to a website or app using your NHS login, we check your NHS number. This allows us to connect you to your information securely.
</p>

<p>

<hr>
            
 <h2 id="error2024">What does reference CID2024 mean?</h2>
 
<p>
If reference CID2024 is shown, this means we do not know what website or app you are trying to log into. This is a technical issue on our side.
</p>

<hr>

  <h2 id="error7020">What does reference CID7020 mean?</h2>

 <p>
If reference CID7020 is shown, this means the website or app you are trying to visit needs to connect to your GP surgery’s system and we have not been able to make that connection.
 </p>

 <p>
There could be a problem with your details, or with your GP surgery's system.
</p>

<p>
To connect to your GP surgery’s system, you can ask your GP surgery for your registration details to their GP online services.
</p>

<p>
You will need:
<ul>
<li>Linkage Key (could be called Passphrase)</li>
<li>O.D.S. Code (could be called Organisation Code or Practice I.D.)</li>
<li>Account I.D.</li>
</ul>
</p>
          
  <p>
Once you have these details, log into the website or app you were trying to access again. You will see the same message with reference CID7020. It will ask you to try another way to connect your NHS login to your GP surgery. Select this and then select ‘Enter your registration details’.
</p>


<hr>

<h2 id="error7021">What does reference CID7021 mean?</h2>
 

 <p>
If reference CID7021 is shown, this means the website or app you are trying to visit needs to connect to your GP surgery’s system and we have not been able to make that connection.
</p>

<p>
This might be because you do not have permission from your GP to use your GP surgery’s online services.
</p>

<p>
You should ask your GP surgery to check if you are able to use their online services.
</p>

<hr>


<h2 id="error7022">What does reference CID7022 mean?</h2>

<p>
If reference CID7022 is shown, this means the website or app you are trying to visit needs to connect to your GP surgery’s system and we have not been able to make that connection.
</p>

<p>
There could be a problem with your details, or with your GP surgery's system.
</p>

<h2 id="error7023">What does reference CID7023 mean?</h2>

<p>
If reference CID7023 is shown, this means the website or app you are trying to visit needs to connect to your GP surgery’s system and we have not been able to make that connection.
</p>

<p>
This is because you have already set up an NHS login using a different email address. We have connected that NHS login to your GP surgery’s system. You can only connect 1 NHS login to your GP surgery’s system.
</p>

<p>
If you want to change the email address on your NHS login you can do so in your <a href="https://settings.login.nhs.uk/">NHS login settings</a>.
