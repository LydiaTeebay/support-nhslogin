 </p>

 <p>
There could be a problem with your details, or with your GP surgery's system.
</p>

<p>
To connect to your GP surgery’s system, ask your GP surgery for your registration details for their GP online services.
</p>

<p>
You will need:
<ul>
<li>Linkage Key (could be called Passphrase)</li>
<li>O.D.S. Code (could be called Organisation Code or Practice I.D.)</li>
<li>Account I.D.</li>
</ul>
</p>
          
  <p>

<p>
  If reference CID7023 is shown, this means the website or app you are trying to visit needs to connect to your GP surgery’s system and we have not been able to make that connection. If this happens to you, there are a number of possible reasons why.
</p>

<h3>You have already set up an NHS login</h3>

<p>
The details we use to make the connection have already been used to connect you to the website or app you are trying to visit.
</p>

<p>This can happen if you have already set up an NHS login using a different email address. We will have connected that NHS login to your GP surgery’s system. You can only connect 1 NHS login to your GP surgery’s system.
</p>

<p>
If you want to change the email address on your NHS login you can do so in your <a href="https://settings.login.nhs.uk/">NHS login settings</a>.
</p>

<h3>The details we use are invalid</h3>

<p>The details we use to make the connection are invalid.</p>

<p>This can happen if:
  <ul>
  <li>you have changed GP surgery</li>
  <li>your GP surgery has changed systems</li>
  <li>you no longer have permission to use your GP surgery’s online services</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

<p>You can ask your GP for new registration details for their online services.</p>
