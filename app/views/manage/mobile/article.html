  <h2 id="changemobile">How to change your mobile phone number</h2>


<p>
You can change your phone number by visiting your <a href="https://settings.login.nhs.uk/">NHS login settings</a>. Under the heading ‘your personal information’ select ‘change phone number’.
</p>

<p>
To visit your NHS login settings, you first need to log in with your NHS login details. To do this, you need access to your previous mobile phone or phone number that is currently on your NHS login.
</p>

<hr>

  <h2 id="lostaccess">You have lost access to your mobile phone number</h2>
 
<p>
If you see reference CID3001, this is because you no longer have access to the phone number on your NHS login. You can change the phone number on your NHS login if you have a backup email address, or by telling us your NHS number.
</p>

<p>
You must contact us if you do not have a backup email address and you do not know your NHS number.
</p>
 
 <hr>

   <h2 id="changelink">The change phone number link in your backup email does not work</h2>


<p>
Your backup email address can be used if you lose access to the mobile phone number on your NHS login. To confirm changing your phone number, you must select the confirmation link we send you. If the link does not work, there are a number of possible reasons why.
</p>

      <h3>Expired link – Reference CID3006</h3>
      
<p>
The link to confirm changing your phone number has a time limit of 24 hours. If it has been more than 24 hours since you received the link in your email, it will no longer work.
</p>

<p>
You will need to try change your phone number again. We will then send you a new confirmation link in your email.
</p>

<p>
Contact us if you did not mean to change your phone number or you think this is a mistake.
</p>

      <h3>Used link – Reference CID3007</h3>

<p>
The link to confirm changing your phone number may not work because you have already used it and have successfully confirmed your change of phone number. You can change your phone number again by visiting your <a href="https://settings.login.nhs.uk/">NHS login settings</a>.
</p>

<p>
Contact us if you did not mean to change your phone number, or you do not have access to the new phone number.
</p>

<hr>

  <h2 id="cancellink">The link to cancel changing your phone number does not work</h2>
 
<p>
To cancel changing your phone number on NHS login, you must select the confirmation link we send you. If the link does not work, there are a number of possible reasons why.
</p>

      <h3>Expired link – Reference CID3002</h3>
      
      <p>
The link to cancel changing your phone number has a time limit of 24 hours. If it has been more than 24 hours since you received the link in your email, it will no longer work.
</p>

<p>
As it has been more than 24 hours, it may be too late to cancel as the phone number may have already been changed. You can check or change your phone number by visiting your <a href="https://settings.login.nhs.uk">NHS login settings</a>.
</p>

<p>
Contact us if you did not mean to change your phone number, or you do not have access to the phone number on your NHS login.
</p>


      <h3>Used link – Reference CID3003</h3>

<p>
The link to cancel changing your phone number may not work because you have already used it and have successfully cancelled changing your phone number. You can check or change your phone number by visiting your <a href="https://settings.login.nhs.uk">NHS login settings</a>.
</p>

<p>
Contact us if you do not have access to the phone number on your NHS login.
