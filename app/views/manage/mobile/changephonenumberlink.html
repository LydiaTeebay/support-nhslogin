      <h1>
The change phone number link in your backup email does not work
        <span class="nhsuk-caption-xl nhsuk-caption--bottom"></span>
      </h1>

<p>
Your backup email address can be used if you lose access to the mobile phone number on your NHS login. To confirm changing your phone number, you must select the confirmation link we send you. If the link does not work, there are a number of possible reasons why.
</p>

      <h2>Expired link – Reference CID3006</h2>
      
<p>
The link to confirm changing your phone number has a time limit of 24 hours. If it has been more than 24 hours since you received the link in your email, it will no longer work.
</p>

<p>
You will need to try change your phone number again. We will then send you a new confirmation link in your email.
</p>

<p>
Contact us if you did not mean to change your phone number or you think this is a mistake.
</p>

      <h2>Used link – Reference CID3007</h2>

<p>
The link to confirm changing your phone number may not work because you have already used it and have successfully confirmed your change of phone number. You can change your phone number again by visiting your <a href="https://settings.login.nhs.uk/">NHS login settings</a>.
</p>

<p>
Contact us if you did not mean to change your phone number, or you do not have access to the new phone number.
