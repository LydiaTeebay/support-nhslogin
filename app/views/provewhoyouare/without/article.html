          If you are registered for your GP surgery’s online services, you will have been given 3 registration details.
        </p>

        <p>The 3 registration details are:
          <ul>
            <li>Linkage Key (could be called Passphrase)</li>
            <li>O.D.S. Code (could be called Organisation Code or Practice I.D.)</li>
            <li>Account I.D.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          You can use these 3 registration details to prove who you are instead of sending a photo of your I.D.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is not the same as the username and password you use to log into your GP surgery’s online services.

          Tell your GP surgery that you want to register for their online services. They will ask you to fill in a form.

        <p>The 3 details you need are:

        <h2 id="detailsused">What to do if your registration details from your GP surgery’s online services have already been used</h2>

        <p>
          Reference CID7004 is shown when the registration details from your GP surgery’s online services have already
          been used to set up an NHS login. This can happen if you are trying to set up a new NHS login with a different
          email address.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can use the 3 registration details from your GP surgery’s online services only once to set up an NHS
          login. Once you have used them once, you cannot use them again on a different NHS login using a different
          email address.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you want to change the email address on your NHS login you can do so by going to your <a
            href="https://settings.login.nhs.uk/">NHS login settings</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you think this is a mistake and you have not used your 3 registration details to set up an NHS login, you
          should <a href="../contact">contact us</a> for help.
        </p>

        <p>You will need to tell us the email address you use for your NHS login.
