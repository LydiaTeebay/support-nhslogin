 <h2 id="recordvideo">How to record a short video</h2>
 
<p>To record a good short video, make sure:</p>
<ul>
<li>you face the camera directly</li>
<li>your face is clear and not covered, for example by a hat or glasses</li>
<li>the video is not too light or dark</li>
</ul>

<p>Before you record your video, we will show you 4 numbers. You will be asked to tell us what the 4 numbers are. To do this you can say the 4 numbers, sign the numbers using British Sign Language, or write the numbers down and show them instead.</p>

<p>If you ask someone to help you, make sure only your face is in the video. Only you can tell us what the numbers are.</p>

<h3>Say the numbers</h3>

<p>If you say the numbers, make sure your voice is loud and clear. It may help to write the numbers down first in case you forget them.</p>

<h3>Write the numbers and show them</h3>

<p>If you write the numbers, make sure they are clear and the paper is not held in front of your face. You should use a thick pen to write down the numbers.</p>

<p>It may be easier to show the numbers before or after you look directly at the camera. We cannot approve you if we cannot see your face clearly in the video.</p>

<h3>Sign the numbers using British Sign Language</h3>

<p>If you sign the numbers, make sure your whole hand is visible and facing the camera. It may be easier to sign the numbers before or after you look directly at the camera.</p>

<p>This is so we can get a clear view of both your face and hands. We cannot approve you if we cannot see your face clearly in the video.</p>

  <h2 id="cameranotwork">Camera does not work when recording a video</h2>

 <p>
 If the camera does not open or shows a black screen when recording a video, this may be a problem with permissions.
 </p>

 <p>
 You should make sure the web browser on your device has camera and microphone permissions. You must also give permission for the NHS login website to access your device’s camera and microphone.
</p>

<h3>iOS devices</h3>

<p>
If you have an iOS device, updating the iOS operating system software on your device to a newer version may also help, if available. Version 11.2 iOS will always show a black screen when trying to open the camera. There is an <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb">Apple support article</a> that describes how to check for updates.
</p>
          
  <h3>Android devices</h3>

  <p>
  If you have an Android device, you should avoid the ‘camera’ option when given a choice of applications to record the video with. You should choose a video option instead, like ‘camcorder’ or ‘capture video’.

<br>
<br>

<h2 id="unabletoreplay">Unable to replay or upload your video</h2>
 

 <p>
 If you cannot replay your video, this could be because the video format captured by your device camera is not supported by your browser.
</p>

<p>
We are testing ways to support additional video formats. In the meantime, users can change the video format of the device to a supported format.
</p>

<p>
For example:
<ul>
<li>video/mp4</li>
<li>video/webm</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
If this does not work, you can also try recording a video on another device. For example, you can use another phone or tablet that belongs to you or a family member.
</p>

<br>
<div style="height:3px; background-color:#005eb8; border:none;"></div>
<br>
<br>


<h2 id="filedamaged">What to do if your video file is damaged</h2>

<p>
We run a virus check on your video file before it is verified. If the file you upload is infected or damaged, you can try and upload another one.
</p>

<p>
If this keeps happening, there might be a problem with your device. You can try recording a video using a different device and upload it from there. For example, you could borrow a family member’s device to record and upload a video instead. Once verified, you can then use NHS login on your usual device as normal.

<h2 id="cameraunavailable">Camera unavailable when trying to record a video</h2>

<p>
If your gallery or file manager opens instead of your camera when trying to record a video, you may have an issue with permissions.
</p>

<p>
You must give permission for your web browser to access the camera and microphone. If your web browser does not have permission, you will not be given the option to use the camera.
</p>

<p>
You must also give permission for the NHS login website to access your device’s camera and microphone.
</p>

<p>
If this problem keeps happening even with permissions allowed, there might be a problem with your device. You can try opening your camera app separately to record a video.
</p>

<p>
If this does not work, you can also try recording a video on another device. For example, you can use another phone or tablet that belongs to you or a family member.

<h2 id="error4011">Reference CID4011: Your video has failed to upload</h2>

<p>
If reference CID4011 is shown, this is because your video has failed to upload. If this keeps happening there may be a problem with your internet connection, or a technical problem on our side.
</p>

<p>
You can try uploading your video another time or use a better internet connection. For example, you should make sure you are using a good Wi-Fi connection. Try using a different Wi-Fi connection if the one you are using does not work.

<h2 id="error4012">Reference CID4012: We cannot validate your video</h2>

<p>
If reference CID4012 is shown, this means we are having technical problems on our side or it might be a problem with your internet connection. This is stopping us from validating your short video.
</p>

<p>
You can try uploading your video another time or use a better internet connection. For example, you should make sure you are using a good Wi-Fi connection. Try using a different Wi-Fi connection if the one you are using does not work.
