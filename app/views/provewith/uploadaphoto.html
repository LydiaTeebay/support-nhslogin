How to upload a photo of your I.D.
        <span class="nhsuk-caption-xl nhsuk-caption--bottom"></span>
      </h1>

      <p>When you choose the type of I.D. you want to use, you will be asked if you want to take a photo or upload an existing photo from your device. When you choose ‘upload a photo’ and select ‘choose a file’ on the next page, a window will open allowing you to choose and upload a file from your device.
</p>

<p>Make sure:
<ul>
<li>you have not covered any part of the page</li>
<li>all 4 edges of the page are in your photo</li>
<li>you can clearly see your face and all the text</li>
<li>there's no shine from a light or window</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h2>Uploading a photo on iOS devices</h2>

<p>
Some iOS users may have problems uploading their photo I.D. If the camera does not open or shows a black screen when taking a photo, this may be a problem with permissions or a known bug in the operating system.
</p>

<p>
Users should make sure the Safari browser on their device has camera and microphone permissions.
</p>

<p>
Updating the iOS operating system software on their device to a newer version may also help, if available. Version 11.2 will always show a black screen when trying to open the camera. There is an <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb">Apple support article</a> that describes how to check for updates.
